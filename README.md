# Tesla OAuth Token Generation
A "proof-of-concept" script on how to interact with the recent OAuth2 changes from Tesla and the new `/oauth2/` endpoint. It was open sources so we could let other people in the community better understand the flow of how secrets were passed around in a token exchange.

## How to run
- Make sure you have Python 3 installed
- Make sure you have ``Requests`` installed
- Run the script while passing in email and password along with a token file (not required)
- If account has MFA enabled you need to pass `--passcode UNUSED_PASSCODE` (passcode generated by your authenticator app) or `--backup_passcode PASSCODE` (one of your unused backup passcodes)

```
bc@anton-mbp ~/H/p/e/tesla-oauth2> python tesla.py -h
usage: tesla.py [-h] -e EMAIL -p PASSWORD [-f FILE] [--verbose]
                [--passcode PASSCODE | --backup_passcode BACKUP_PASSCODE]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -e EMAIL, --email EMAIL
                        tesla account email
  -p PASSWORD, --password PASSWORD
                        tesla account password
  -f FILE, --file FILE  filename to save tokens
  --verbose             be verbose
  --passcode PASSCODE   Passcode generated by your authenticator app
  --backup_passcode BACKUP_PASSCODE
                        Unused backup passcode
```
